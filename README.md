# MyDotNetSolution

This is a .NET Core solution that implements a clean architecture with a focus on the repository pattern, caching, messaging, and transaction handling. The solution is structured into multiple projects to separate concerns and promote maintainability.

## Project Structure

- **Core**: Contains core interfaces and models.
  - **Interfaces**: Defines contracts for repositories, caching, messaging, and unit of work.
  - **Models**: Contains entity models used throughout the application.

- **Infrastructure**: Implements the interfaces defined in the Core project.
  - **Repositories**: Provides concrete implementations for data access.
  - **Caching**: Implements caching functionality.
  - **Messaging**: Handles message queue operations.
  - **UnitOfWork**: Manages transactions across multiple repositories.

- **Application**: Contains application services and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
  - **Services**: Contains business logic and interacts with repositories and other services.
  - **DTOs**: Defines DTOs used for transferring data between layers.

- **API**: The entry point for the application, handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MyDotNetSolution
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project API/API.csproj
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- The API project serves as the entry point for the application. You can interact with the application through the defined controllers.
- The Application project contains services that encapsulate business logic, while the Infrastructure project handles data access and external service interactions.
- Use the Core project to define new interfaces and models as needed.
